The Turtle Race Game is a Python program that simulates a race between colorful turtles on the screen. Players can start the race, watch the turtles race to the finish line, and even play again.


How to Play

Run the turtle_race_game.py script.

You will be asked if you want to start the game. Type "yes" to start the game or anything else to exit.

The game will create six colorful turtles at the starting line and a finish line on the right side of the screen.

A countdown will appear on the screen, and the race will start after the countdown.

The turtles will move forward at different speeds.

When a turtle crosses the finish line on the right side, the race will end, and the winning turtle's color and time will be displayed.

You can choose to play again or exit the game.

Features
Randomly generated turtle speeds for each race.
Easy-to-understand graphical user interface using the turtle library.
Option to play the game multiple times.
Game Controls
To start the race, type "yes" when prompted.
To play again, type "yes" when prompted after the race finishes.

Code Explanation
The code consists of two main functions: start_race() and restart_game(). These functions handle the game logic, including race initialization, race completion, and game restart.



The game uses the turtle library for graphics and animation. Six turtles with different colors are created, and they move forward at varying speeds. The game calculates the winning turtle based on the first one to cross the finish line.
